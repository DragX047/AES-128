    "\n",
    "We have learned AES on lectures. This assignment aims to develop its practical applications and analyze security.\n",
    "You will face two kinds of questions: short-answer questions and implementation questions. They always start with a red <font color=\"red\">Question xx</font>. There are <b>14 Questions</b> in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "For short answer questions, please type your answer in the next block (by double click that block).\n",
    "\n",
    "For implementation questions, please finish the corresponding implementation by typing your code between the comments <font color=\"green\">\"You code starts\"</font> and <font color=\"green\">\"You code ends\"</font>. Please read the requiremnts carefully for each question. Unable to follow them will attract 0 marks for corresponding questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total marks for this assignment is 130, contributing as 13% to the subject marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. <b> You should use Python 3</b>. Our marking script is running at Python 3.10.16.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">Important: Importing any library is prohibited! Using any of them will attract 0 mark for all corresponding questions!</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourage you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the University’s Academic Misconduct policy where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place."

    "Padding Oracle Attacks: While all-zero padding might seem to avoid some pitfalls of schemes like PKCS#7, it does not eliminate the risk of padding oracle attacks if the system leaks information about padding errors.

    "Explanation\n",
    "Background: AES-CBC with Fixed IV and Tag as Last Ciphertext Block\n",
    "In this scheme, the IV is always 0x00.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tag for a message $m$ is defined as the last ciphertext block after CBC encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adversary can query Alice for the tag of any message $m$ (chosen-plaintext access).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is This Insecure?\n",
    "A fixed IV in CBC mode breaks semantic security and enables attacks, especially when the tag is just the last ciphertext block. This structure is essentially CBC-MAC with a fixed IV, which is only secure if all messages are of fixed, equal length and the MAC is not used for variable-length messages or as a general-purpose MAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Can an Adversary Forge a Tag?\n",
    "Suppose the adversary queries Alice for the tag of message m1 and receives tag t1. The adversary\n",
    "can then construct a new message m2 by appending a new block b to m1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let m2 =m1||b (where || denotes concatenation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tag for m2 will be Ek (b (+) t1), where Ek is AES encryption under key k.((+) denotes XOR operation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The adversary can choose b = t2(+)t1, where t2 is any desired tag value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the adversary to craft a message whose tag is any chosen value, demonstrating existential forgery.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attack is a well-known weakness of CBC-MAC when used improperly (e.g., with variable-length messages or as a general-purpose MAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference from Stallings\n",
    "Stallings (7th Edition) discusses this on CBC-MAC and the importance of using a random IV or additional structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "“If the IV is fixed, then for any two messages that begin with the same block, the first ciphertext block will be the same. This enables an attacker to build a dictionary of plaintext/ciphertext pairs and to launch various attacks. For CBC-MAC, the use of a fixed IV is only secure when all messages are of a fixed length.”\n",
